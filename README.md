# Poke-Stonks
- The goal of my project is to create a full stack application that will allow for the following features
    - Create a user profile 
    - Allow the user to add cards to their collection
    - Find users nationally that are interested in making a trade for a card in real time
- The application UI will implement a chart that tracks total value of their collection, similiar to how stock prices are tracked

# API's
- For tracking card values: https://dev.pokemontcg.io/
- Google maps API that displays local card meetup spots for assisting in trading cards in real time
- An API for helping create an account. Potentially using a "log in with google" api to help user create an account faster

# Design
- Navbar 
- profile picture
- dynamic line chart displaying value of collection
- image of the 3 most valualbe cards in collection
- integrated google maps api for local card shops in area
- blog area for pokemon card discussions
